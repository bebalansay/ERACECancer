                <p class="lead">How US Healthcare is broken and Community Health Workers can Help</p>

                <p>Addressing a crowded room at the national convention of the Medical Committee for Human Rights in a Chicago hotel in 1966, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. declared discriminatory health policy uniquely offensive: “Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in healthcare is the most shocking and inhuman.”  Almost fifty years later, the health care system of the United States remains a model of injustice.  The US is a signatory to multiple international treaties that conceive of good health as an inalienable human right, but the current American health care system is plagued by structural inefficiencies that lead to health disparities.  Americans pay exorbitant prices for health care relative to their OECD counterparts, the absence of universal health insurance continues to bankrupt families and endanger health outcomes, and population-specific differences in the presence of disease and quality of care exist along racial and ethnic divides.  However, by enacting the reforms introduced in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and specifically focusing on incorporating community health workers into the medical workforce, the US can improve health outcomes and reduce healthcare disparities across the US.</p>

                   <p>The belief that adequate healthcare is a universal human right was codified in international treaties beginning in 1948.  The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on December 10, 1948, was the first global attempt to enumerate the rights to which all human beings are inherently entitled.  Article 25 of the UDHR states that, “Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care...”  In 1966, the United Nations refined their commitment to the right to health in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  Article 12 of the Covenant, which has 160 signatories but lacks US ratification, commits its parties to “recognize the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.”   Signatories further commit to achieving the full realization of this right by “provisioning for the creation of conditions which would assure to all medical service and medical attention in the event of sickness.”  Subsequent UN treaties, comments, and covenants reaffirmed the right to health and were complemented by the constitution of the World Health Organization, which declares “the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being.”  Every country in the world is now party to at least one human rights treaty that addresses health-related rights.  In many treaties, signatories commit not only to a theoretical ideal of “health,” but a series of provisions and conditions deemed necessary to achieve health (e.g. lower infant mortality, industrial hygiene, decreased mental health, etc.).  Unfortunately, despite repeated commitments, global health targets remain elusive and even highly developed countries fail to achieve adequate healthcare within their borders.</p>

                   <p>The United States stands apart among highly-developed countries for its abysmal health outcomes and rampant, inflated spending.  According to the most recent WHO ranking of global health systems, the US is 37th, one spot above Slovenia.  The US spent approximately $2.6 trillion on health expenditures in 2010 and yet has worse rates of death and a higher disease burden than countries that spend far less.  In both life expectancy and infant mortality measurements, the US performs below the OECD average.  Americans spend 5.6 times more on overnight hospital stays than their age- and gender-matched Japanese counterparts.  And even though the US spends $2,797 more per person every year than the next highest spending country, 55 million Americans under the age of 65 remain uninsured. </p>

                      <p>While the comprehensive picture of the American health system is bleak, minority populations within the US are subject to disproportionately threatening racial and ethnic disparities in health outcomes.  Low performance on health indicators ranging from the prevalence of chronic disease to infant mortality to insurance coverage reveal differences between minority populations and white Americans.  The statistical examples of disparities relative to white populations are abundant: infants born to black women are 1.5 to 3 times more likely to die than infants born to white women, African American men are more than twice as likely to die from prostate cancer, American Indians and Alaska Natives are twice as likely to develop diabetes before the age of 35.  Even when income, health insurance, and access to care are controlled for, disparities in outcomes remain.  Fortunately, the Affordable Care Act intentionally addresses health disparities in hopes of reducing the inequalities faced by minority populations.</p>

                p>The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), signed into law in March 2010, has provisions to improve the quality of care, reduce costs, increase access to care, and significantly reduce disparities in health.  The most impactful element of the ACA is the expansion of insurance coverage.  Recent results from “the Oregon Experiment,” a random trial of medicaid assignment, have confirmed that expanding insurance coverage provides a cost-effective avenue for improving health outcomes.  Beginning in 2014, the ACA prevents insurance companies from denying coverage to people who have pre-existing conditions or charging high premiums based on gender, race, or ethnicity.  Minorities are disproportionately affected by chronic conditions including diabetes, heart disease, and cancer, and this provision is a direct attempt to expand coverage to these at risk populations.  The ACA also institutes an expansion of federally-funded surveys of health data on race, ethnicity, sex, primary language, and disability statues.  Under the reorganized Office of Minority Health, the new data will be analyzed for “threats to minority health... and health disparities.”  While the 906 pages of the ACA contain many additional adjustments to the US health system, one of the most important elements of the legislation concerns the creation of a new occupational category: Community Health Workers (CHW).  </p>

    <p>Community Health Workers, or Promotores de Salud, are community network members who function as bridges between patients and the health care delivery systems.  The CHW model has existed within the United States since the 1950s, but has received renewed interest after the documented success of CHWs in health intervention programs internationally.  One of the most prominent proponents of the establishment of a CHW sector of the health workforce is Dr. Paul Farmer, founder of the global health nonprofit Partners in Health.  Farmer has fervently built CHWs into his international health campaigns following PIH’s success in using CHWs to contain and treat multi-drug resistant tuberculosis outbreaks in Chiapas, Mexico and Lima, Peru in the late 1980s.  In 2004, Farmer and his team published results from their use of CHWs in rural Haiti that showed that the use of accompagnateurs, the Haitian version of CHWs, in HIV+ communities resulted in fewer hospitalizations, opportunistic infections, cases of tuberculosis, and reduced mortality relative to traditional clinical treatment.  Building off of successful CHW-implementation abroad, urban health systems are increasingly turning to community-based health programs.  </p>

    <p>The Prevention and Access to Care and Treatment project (PACT) is a compelling example of the potential health benefits produced from incorporating CHWs into existing healthcare infrastructure.  PACT was founded in 1997 by Paul Farmer, Jim Kim, and Heidi Behforouz and was created to serve the HIV/AIDS population of Boston.  The stated goals of PACT are twofold: to improve the health of patients while simultaneously reducing the cost of their treatment.  Currently, PACT is jointly run by Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Harvard Medical School’s primary teaching hospital, and Partners in Health.  PACT enrolls HIV patients who are referred by their providers as having “failed standard care.”  These patients are nearly all Latino or Black men and women who live below the poverty line in Boston’s least-affluent neighborhoods.  The majority of PACT patients also prove extremely costly to treat because they frequently utilize emergency medical services, suffer from recurrent symptoms, and require regular hospitalizations.  </p>

    <p>The founders of PACT believed that the secret to treating HIV/AIDS patients from impoverished neighborhoods was to empower community members from the same neighborhoods as their patient population.  The PACT CHW workforce is composed of friends and family of patients, former patients and is open to community members, regardless of educational background.  PACT CHWs receive 60 hours of field-based training and 60 hours of didactic training and continue to receive 5-8 hours of training supervision by social workers and physicians per week throughout their employment.  After the training is completed, the CHWs immediately begin working with patients.  Each CHW-patient relationship begins with an intake where the CHW evaluates “patient needs and characteristics, adherence strengths and barriers, environmental and social context, and social support network.” The assessment is completed over a four week period and followed by the construction of a “personalized service plan” that combines the patient’s goals with clinician’s targets; patient goals are predominantly functional, while clinical targets usually focus on biological benchmarks like CD4 counts.  CHWs are also trained to facilitate referrals to service agencies providing assistance with financial, housing, or legal issues.  </p>

    <p>The community-based model of healthcare embodied by CHWs incorporates a dimension of social contextualization into treatment programs.  The CHWs emic understanding of their community’s cultural strengths and values provides them with the background necessary to tailor treatment and support structures to patients’ needs.  CHWs do not supplant the work of doctors or nurses, but serve as a vital interface between the clinic and the community.  As such, they have the ability to enhance the relationship between patients and medical professionals.  The shared communal origins of CHW and patient enables the CHW to have a working knowledge of not only the life circumstances of the clients, but also the cultural health-related norms surrounding particular diseases.  This knowledge improves the ability of the CHW to provide comprehensive, relevant, and effective care.  </p>

    <p>In follow-up assessments, the PACT community-based approach has proven to improve the health of patients and reduce costs to the Massachusetts health system.  One year post-enrollment in PACT’s HIV/AIDS program, 70% of participating patients observed significant health improvements, demonstrated by decreased viral load and elevated CD4 counts.  Analysis of patients’ Medicaid claims reveals a 16% net savings in total medical expenditure two years after enrollment.  This cost-savings is attributed to a 35% reduction in the length of hospital stays and inpatient costs.  Under the ACA, the PACT program is expanding to the NYC Department of Health and community-based health initiatives are candidates for federal grant funding.  </p>

    <p>CHWs have specifically proven to help reduce healthcare costs by helping people.  By strengthening the social support system of patients, health outcomes are improved and the health care system is utilized more effectively.  The current healthcare landscape of the US is rife with structural barriers inhibiting minority populations from accessing and utilizing medical care.  The Affordable Care Act begins addressing these disparities and designates resources to developing community-based models of healthcare.  By investing in CHWs, the US can simultaneously address the exorbitant healthcare spending that endangers long-term financial stability and satisfy its human rights-based obligations to provide an adequate standard of care to the country’s neediest populations.  </p>
